# Realtor Co
Super simple aesthetically pleasing landing page for a realtor site.

I made this site as I was still learning so some of the raw code might be scuffed or overcomplicated, but the design is there. 

Uploaded to Github to finish out the project, feel free to use what is already available ✌️

## Plans
- Convert to full Flask application.
- Scrape data on Zillow, Realtor, Apartments, etc.
    - Section by zip/city.
- Store data in SQLite database.
    - Push data to front end when a zip/city is called.
